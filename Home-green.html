            <p>An automobile is a self-propelled motor vehicle intended for passenger
                transportation on land. It usually has four wheels and an internal
                combustion engine fueled most often by gasoline, a liquid petroleum
                product.The word "automobile" comes from the Greek prefix "αυτό" (self) and the Latin word "mobilis"
                (moving). This name means "self-moving", as cars run on their own power and do not need horses or other
                power from outside to move.</p>

            <p>A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run
                primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.
            </p><br><br>
            <p>The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while the
                Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered
                automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in
                1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became
                widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the Ford
                Model T, begun in 1908, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly
                adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages. In Europe and other parts of the world,
                demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II. The car is considered an essential
                part of the developed economy.</p><br><br>

            <p>Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lamps. Over the decades,
                additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex.
                These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment.
                Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the
                combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became
                commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than petrol-driven cars before
                2025. The transition from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most
                climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate
                change.</p><br><br>
            <p>There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle,
                interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time,
                parking fees, taxes, and insurance. The costs to society include maintaining roads, land-use, road
                congestion, air pollution, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of
                its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. Personal
                benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience. Societal
                benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry,
                transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and the generation
                of revenue from taxation. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching
                implications for the nature of societies. There are around one billion cars in use worldwide. Car
                usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialised countries.
